For my Processes of Object-Oriented Software class, my team was tasked with making a puzzle game. The game consisted of trying to get a ball on one side of the level to get to the goal on the other side using different parts to avoid obstacles For this I was put in charge of animation, both in terms of drawing/creating the assets and putting them into the game in which certain conditions would change the animation smoothly. The file above is one such instance of the adding the animation into the game and having it change depending on the conditions.  
   
The ball had different states it could be in: regular, light, and heavy. The state of the ball would be dependent on if it ran into a transformer with its name respective to the state the ball would turn to.
