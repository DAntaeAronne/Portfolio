In this code sample the user is prompted to input 1 of the 9 pattern types used in training, from there the corresponding folder containing the training is found and lists the directory. The list is gone through, passing each image one at a time for the AI to read. Once the image is received it is then adjusted to be easier to read for the AI who then determines the shapes inside and prints out a copy of the image containing labels and outlines for the shape for us to see if it is correctly detecting and labeling them. It then waits until we press a button to have it move on to the next image, which was done to give us proper time to study the image as well as have time to stop the execution of the code if we started to notice a pattern in what/why it was getting them incorrect if it was at all.
