During my undergraduate research, I was given the oppurtunity to create an AI that can solve a Raven Progressive Matrix (RPM). 
    
For context, an RPM is a is 3x3 matrix in which the rows follow the same specific pattern though the shapes, size, and/or color of the shapes may vary accordingly. Only the first 2 rows are completely filled out with the 3rd row only having the first 2 columns filled. The last space is left empty as it is to be filled with one of the 8 answer choices, the correct answer choice would be the one that best fits the 3rd row following the pattern. The focus of RPM's being on pattern recognition, problem solving, and adaptability.
